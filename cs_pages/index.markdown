I do machine learning research, focusing on medical applications of
causal discovery in electronic health records databases.  My research
interests include causal inference, probabilistic graphical models,
event history analysis / time series, multi-relational rule learning,
and databases.

In 2019, I earned my PhD in [Computer Sciences](
https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) from the [University of Wisconsin](
https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [David Page](
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dpage/) (who has moved to [Duke](
https://scholars.duke.edu/person/david.page)).  My [dissertation](
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~barnard/barnard_dissertation.pdf) was on
discovering the adverse effects of medications, through learning the
structure of Bayesian network causal models, and through analyzing
observational studies with machine learning for hypothesizing drug
effects.  This research produced a new method for Bayesian network
structure learning, and a novel causal discovery machine learning
approach based on analyzing before–after studies with temporal inverse
probability weighting.

While I mostly work with [Python]( https://www.python.org/) (e.g.,
[scikit-learn]( https://scikit-learn.org/), [NumPy]( https://numpy.org/)
/ [SciPy]( https://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](
https://matplotlib.org/), [PyTorch]( https://pytorch.org/)), I have been
writing all my numerical code in [Julia]( https://julialang.org/).  It
is as easy to use as Python—it is interactive, high-level, expressive,
multi-paradigm, dynamically-typed—but it runs at [machine speed](
https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) and has linear algebra and
concurrency built in.  I encourage you to [check](
https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/) [Julia](
https://docs.julialang.org/) [out]( https://julialang.org/learning/)!

I ran the UW–Madison [ML and AI Reading Group](
https://wiscairg.github.io/) for 5 semesters.

Research Interests
------------------

* Causality
* Probabilistic graphical models
* Event sequences / time series (patient histories in electronic health
  records can be modeled as irregular, sparse, and noisy sequences of
  events)
* Multi-Relational rule learning (inductive logic programming)
* Databases


Other Interests
---------------

* Open source software
* Software design and development
* Programming languages
* Linux
* Go (the [game]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), but the
  [language]( https://golang.org/) is cool, too)


Current Projects
----------------

* Effects of common drugs in electronic health records on the survival
  of patients
* Learning the structure of Markov and Bayesian networks via convex
  optimization
* Faster optimization for log-linear models
